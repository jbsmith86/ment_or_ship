Ment or Ship assignment
============

The site I made is a basic example of a has_many :through association that connects a Person model to a Business model through a Membership model.

A person can sign in and visit the show page for a business. There, they can become a "memeber" in order to get more information from the business or cancel their membership if a Memebership relation already exists.

collab/sources: none
